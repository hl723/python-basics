# multiplication_table.py - creates a multiplication table in excel with N rows
"""
Create a program multiplicationTable.py that takes a number N from the command line
and creates an NÃ—N multiplication table in an Excel spreadsheet.

Note with this module! There have been updates to openpyxl since Automate The Boring Stuff
was written and it has caused a lot of syntax to change.
